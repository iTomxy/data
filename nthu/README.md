NTHU [1] is a road scene image dataset.
Images are collected from 4 cities,
1,600 image pairs (i.e. 3,200 images) from each city.
1,000 images from each city are annotated with pixel-wise class label.
The class set,
containing `13` classes,
is:
```
road, sidewalk, building, trafﬁc light, trafﬁc sign,
vegetation, sky, person, rider, car,
bus, motorcycle, bicycle
```
all of which are included in the [Cityscapes](../cityscapes/README.md) class set.
